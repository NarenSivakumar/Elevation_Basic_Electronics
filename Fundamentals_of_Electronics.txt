1. Ohm's law:
      V = IR. 
  Definition : the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided all physical conditions and temperatures remain constant.
Real - world problem:

2. Kirchoff's law: KVL and KCL
   
   KVL - Kirchoff's voltage law : 
   Definition : The sum of all voltage around a closed loop is zero.
   Example : A 12V battery and series 2 - 6V bulbs.
   Application :   1. Transformer and Motor windings - Helps in designing transformer coil windings by ensuring proper voltage balance.
                   2. used in EVs and UPS to monitors the voltage drops. 

   KCL - Kirchoff's current law:
   Definition: The sum of currents entering node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the node
   $' Iin = Iout '$
   Example: Wifi adapter - 2A.
   2A = 0.3A + 1.2A + 0.5A
   Application: PCB - used for Ensures current is properly distributed in Electronic circuit boards.

3. Series and Parallel circuits :
    Series circuits have a single path for current, while parallel circuits offer multiple paths (branches), allowing current to flow through different routes simultaneously.
    Series circuits: 
    1. closed circuit
    2. Not common in homes.
    3. Unreliable wiring method
    4. Failure affects all the devices.
    formula:  R = R1 + R2 + ....Rn
    
    Parallel cicruit:
    1. closed circuit
    2. commonly used in homes.
    3. Reliable wiring method
    4. Failure does not affects all the device like series.
    formula: 1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2+ ...  1/Rn

4. Voltage, Current, Resistance and Power: with real-world examples
      i. Voltage (V) ‚Äì It is the electrical pressure or force that pushes electric charges (electrons) through a conductor.
      Example: Think of voltage like water pressure in a pipe. A higher voltage means more force pushing the electricity, just like higher water pressure pushes water faster           through a hose.
      
      ii. Current (I) ‚Äì It is the flow of electric charge (electrons) through a conductor. Measured in Amperes (A).
      Example: Just like water flowing through a pipe, electric current is the flow of electrons through a wire.
      
      iii. Resistance (R) ‚Äì It is the opposition to the flow of electric current in a circuit. Measured in Ohms (Œ©).
      Example: A narrow pipe slows down the water flow, just like resistance in a wire slows down the electric current.
      
      iv. Power (P) ‚Äì It is the rate at which electrical energy is used or transferred. Measured in Watts (W).
      Example: A 100W light bulb consumes 100 watts of power when turned on, just like a water pump uses power to push water.

5. AC Vs. DC Circuits: with real-world example
      i. AC (Alternating Current)

      The electric current changes direction periodically (flows back and forth).
      
      Example: The electricity from wall sockets (power supply in homes, offices) is AC.
      
      Uses: Powering home appliances like TVs, refrigerators, and fans.
      
      Transmission: Can travel long distances efficiently.
      
      Voltage level: Can be increased or decreased using transformer.
      
      ii. DC (Direct Current)
      
      The electric current flows in only one direction.
      
      Example: Batteries (AA, AAA, mobile phone batteries, car batteries) provide DC power.
      
      Uses: Mobile phones, laptops, and electronic circuits use DC power.
      
      Transmission: Not suitable for long distance transmission.
      
      Voltage level: Generally fixed or slowly decreasing in batteries
      
      Real-Life Comparison: 
      i. AC is like ocean waves üåä (moving back and forth).
      ii. DC is like a river üèûÔ∏è (flowing in one direction).

      Calculation part: 
      For AC: ALternating Current
      RMS (Root Mean Square) Value for AC:
      Since AC voltage continuously changes, we use RMS value to represent its effective voltage.
      '/Vrms = Vpeak/#2'/

      For DC: Direct Current
      DC is straightforward because the current and voltage remain constant.
      '/Ohm's law: V = IR'/
