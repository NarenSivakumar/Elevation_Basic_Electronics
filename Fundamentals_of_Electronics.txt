1. Ohm's law:
      V = IR. 
  Definition : the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided all physical conditions and temperatures remain constant.
Real - world problem:

2. Kirchoff's law: KVL and KCL
   
   KVL - Kirchoff's voltage law : 
   Definition : The sum of all voltage around a closed loop is zero.
   Example : A 12V battery and series 2 - 6V bulbs.
   Application :   1. Transformer and Motor windings - Helps in designing transformer coil windings by ensuring proper voltage balance.
                   2. used in EVs and UPS to monitors the voltage drops. 

   KCL - Kirchoff's current law:
   Definition: The sum of currents entering node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the node
   $' Iin = Iout '$
   Example: Wifi adapter - 2A.
   2A = 0.3A + 1.2A + 0.5A
   Application: PCB - used for Ensures current is properly distributed in Electronic circuit boards.

3. Series and Parallel circuits :
    Series circuits have a single path for current, while parallel circuits offer multiple paths (branches), allowing current to flow through different routes simultaneously.
    Series circuits: 
    1. closed circuit
    2. Not common in homes.
    3. Unreliable wiring method
    4. Failure affects all the devices.
    formula:  R = R1 + R2 + ....Rn
    
    Parallel cicruit:
    1. closed circuit
    2. commonly used in homes.
    3. Reliable wiring method
    4. Failure does not affects all the device like series.
    formula: 1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2+ ...  1/Rn
