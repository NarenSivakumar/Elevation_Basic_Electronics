This section contains basic Electronic Components.

1. Resistor 
  Definition: A resistor is a passive electronic component that limits or controls the flow of electric current in a circuit. It is measured in Ohms (Ω).
   Basic Formula - Ohms law: V = IR
  
  --> Resistor Color Code: BBROYGBVGW : BBROYGreatBritanVeryGoodWife and then Gold, Silver. also the value will be start and ends  0 to 9. 
  Resistors use colored bands to indicate their resistance value. The color code chart follows a 4-band, 5-band, or 6-band system.
  
  -- To read a 4-band resistor, always read the color bands from left to right, with the most significant digit on the left and the tolerance band on the right.
  -- The first two bands represent the first two digits, the third band is the multiplier, and the fourth band is the tolerance. 

   How to Read a 4-Band Resistor?

    Example: Brown, Black, Red, Gold
    First digit (Brown) = 1
    Second digit (Black) = 0
    Multiplier (Red) = 10^2 = 100
    Tolerance (Gold) = ±5%
    Resistance Value:
    10 × 100 = 1000Ω = 1𝑘Ω ( ±5% )

    Applications of Resistors
    Resistors are widely used in electrical and electronic circuits.
    
    🔹 Common Applications:
    
    Current Limiting – Controls current in LED circuits to prevent burning.
    Voltage Divider – Used in circuits to step down voltage.
    Filtering – Used in combination with capacitors to smooth signals in power supplies.
    Heating Elements – Used in electric heaters where resistance generates heat.
    Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors – Used in microcontrollers and logic circuits.

2. Capacitor
  
  Definition: A capacitor is an electronic component that stores and releases electrical energy. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material           (dielectric).
  Formula: C/QV
  
  Working: 
  A Capacitor stores energy when connected to power source and releases it when needed.
  The two phases are Charging Phase and Discharging Phase.
  
  Types: Ceramic, Electrolytic, Supercapacitors, Film.

  Application of Capacitors:
  ✔ Energy Storage – Used in camera flashes, UPS, and backup power.
  ✔ Filtering & Smoothing – Removes noise from power supplies (used in TVs, laptops).
  ✔ Signal Coupling & Decoupling – Used in audio circuits (radios, microphones).
  ✔ Power Factor Correction – Used in industries to improve efficiency.
  ✔ Timing Circuits – Used in oscillators (watches, alarms).

  Real-World Example: Fan Regulator Circuit
🔹 Problem: Traditional resistors-based fan regulators waste energy as heat.
🔹 Solution: Capacitor-based fan regulators adjust speed efficiently by controlling voltage without excess heat loss.

  ✅ How it Works?
  Different capacitor values determine the fan speed by controlling the current flow.
  Higher capacitance → Higher speed
  Lower capacitance → Lower speed
  ✔ Used in Ceiling Fans, Air Conditioners, and Inverters to regulate power and efficiency.

  📌 Summary:  
  ✔ A capacitor stores & releases energy in a circuit.
  ✔ Used for filtering, timing, and power regulation.
  ✔ Real-world example: Fan speed control, power supplies, and EVs.

3. Inductor:

  Definition: An Inductor is an passive electronic component that stores energy in the form of magnetic field when current flows through it.
  Formula : V = LdI/dt 
  V - Voltage across the inductor
  L - Inductance
  dI/dt - Rate of change of current

  Working Principle:
  🔹 When Current flows, an inductor creates a magnetic field around it.
  🔹 When current changes - increases or decreases, the inductor opposes the change by inducing a voltage.
  🔹 If the power is cut, the inductor releases the stores energy back into the circuit.

  Application:
  🔹 Power supply filtering: Removes AC noises in DC circuits.
  🔹 Transformers: Used in Electrical transmission and voltage conversion.
  🔹 Wireless charging: Transfers the energy through magnetic induction.

  Real-World Example: Inductor in a Mobile charger
  🔹 Problem: A charger needs to convert high AC voltage to stable DC voltage.
  🔹 Solution: The inductor in the power supply filters high-frequency noise and ensures the smooth current flow.
    The working of it: The inductor stores the energy from AC supply. 
   --> it then smoothes out the voltage fluctuations in the DC output.
   -->This prevent overheating and improving efficiency.

  Used in: Mobile chargers, power supplies and Voltage regulators.

  📌 Summary:
  🔹 An inductor stores & releases energy in a magnetic field.
  🔹 It opposes the sudden current change in a circuit.
  🔹 Used in: Power supplies, transformers, wireless charging.

  Traffic vs Inductor Example: 
  Imagine cars moving on a Highway.
  If a red signal suddenly changes into green cars cannot reach full speed instantly. 
  If the signal changes green into red. the cars cannot stop suddenly, it'll reduce the speed gradually.

  Conclusion: An inductor smooths out sudden changes in current. 

4. Diodes:
   
  Definition:  A diode is two terminal semiconductor devices that allows current flows in only one direction. It consists of a PN junction that forms a barrier, allowing          current to pass when forward-biased and blocking it when reverse-biased.

  i. PN Junction Diode:
  A PN junction diode is the most basic type of diode, formed by joining P-type (positive) and N-type (negative) semiconductors.

  Working Principle:
  Forward Bias: Allows current flow.
  Reverse Bias: Blocks current flow.

  Example: Rectifiers in power suppliers.

  ii. Zener diode:
  A Zener diode is a special type of diode that operates in reverse bias and maintains a constant voltage after reaching the Zener breakdown voltage.

  Working Principle:
  In reverse bias, it allows current to flow when the voltage exceeds a certain breakdown value. Used for voltage regulation.

  Example: Voltage regulators.

  iii. Schottky diode:
  A Schottky diode is made of a metal-semiconductor junction, offering low forward voltage drop and fast switching speed.

  Working Principle:
  Has a lower voltage drop (~0.2V–0.4V) compared to a standard silicon diode (~0.7V). Used in high-speed switching applications.

  Example: Power supplies for efficient energy conversion.

  iv. Light Emitting Diode (LED)
  A Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a diode that emits light when forward biased.

  Working Principle:
  When current flows through the LED, electrons and holes recombine, releasing energy in the form of light (electroluminescence).

  Example: Display panels - TVs, Smartphones
  Automobile headlights.
