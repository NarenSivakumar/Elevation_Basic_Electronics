This section contains basic Electronic Components.

1. Resistor 
  Definition: A resistor is a passive electronic component that limits or controls the flow of electric current in a circuit. It is measured in Ohms (Ω).
   Basic Formula - Ohms law: V = IR
  
  --> Resistor Color Code: BBROYGBVGW : BBROYGreatBritanVeryGoodWife and then Gold, Silver. also the value will be start and ends  0 to 9. 
  Resistors use colored bands to indicate their resistance value. The color code chart follows a 4-band, 5-band, or 6-band system.
  
  -- To read a 4-band resistor, always read the color bands from left to right, with the most significant digit on the left and the tolerance band on the right.
  -- The first two bands represent the first two digits, the third band is the multiplier, and the fourth band is the tolerance. 

   How to Read a 4-Band Resistor?

    Example: Brown, Black, Red, Gold
    First digit (Brown) = 1
    Second digit (Black) = 0
    Multiplier (Red) = 10^2 = 100
    Tolerance (Gold) = ±5%
    Resistance Value:
    10 × 100 = 1000Ω = 1𝑘Ω ( ±5% )

    Applications of Resistors
    Resistors are widely used in electrical and electronic circuits.
    
    🔹 Common Applications:
    
    Current Limiting – Controls current in LED circuits to prevent burning.
    Voltage Divider – Used in circuits to step down voltage.
    Filtering – Used in combination with capacitors to smooth signals in power supplies.
    Heating Elements – Used in electric heaters where resistance generates heat.
    Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors – Used in microcontrollers and logic circuits.
