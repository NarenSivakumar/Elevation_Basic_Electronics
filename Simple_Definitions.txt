Simple Core Definition 

Topology - means how the devices are physically or logically linked.

MATLAB [Matrix Laboratory]– A tool used for numerical computing, simulation, and algorithm development.

Ansys – Software for engineering simulation like stress, heat, and fluid flow analysis.

MotorCAD – Used to design and simulate electric motors and thermal performance.

CAD – Software for creating precise 2D and 3D engineering designs.

AC (Alternating Current) – Electric current that reverses direction periodically.

DC (Direct Current) – Electric current that flows in one direction only.

Voltage – The electrical pressure that pushes current through a circuit.

Current – The flow of electric charge through a conductor.

EMF (Electromotive Force) – The energy provided per charge by a source like a battery.
