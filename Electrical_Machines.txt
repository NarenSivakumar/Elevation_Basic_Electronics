Electrical Machines overview:
  Definition: An Electrical Machine is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy (Motor) 
  or mechanical energy into electrical energy (Generator).

 Main Parts of an Electrical Machine
   i.   Stator 🏗️ → The stationary part (outer frame)
   ii.  Rotor 🔄 → The rotating part that interacts with the stator.
   iii. Windings 🔌 → Coils of wire that carry current to produce magnetic fields.
   iv.  Core 🏗️ → Provides a path for magnetic flux.
   v.   Bearings ⚙️ → Reduce friction between moving parts.

1. Power Factor
    Definition: Power factor is the ratio of real power and reactive power in an AC circuit.
    It's used to indicate how efficiently electrical power is used.

    cos o = P/S  
  Where:
       P (Watts) → Real Power (Used for work)
       S (VA) → Apparent Power (Total supplied power)

    Why is Power Factor Important?
    Low PF → Wastes energy, increases electricity bills.
    High PF → Efficient power usage, reduces losses.
  
    Real-World Example: Running vs. Walking 🚶‍♂️🏃‍♂️
    High Power Factor (PF ≈ 1) → Running straight (efficient movement).
    Low Power Factor (PF < 1) → Walking in a zig-zag (wasted effort).

    Conclusion:  Improving the PF
    To Increase the PF we typically add extra capactors to the circuit.
    Capacitors provide a leading current that counteracts the lagging current caused by inductive loads. 
    This brings the voltage and current waveforms closer to being in phase, increasing the power factor and improving the system’s efficiency.    
      

2. Transformers:
    Definition: A Transformer is a static electrical machine that transfers electrical energy between circuits 
    through electromagnetic induction.
  
    Basic Working:
    i. Primary Coil → Receives AC voltage and creates a magnetic field.
    ii. Core → Transfers the magnetic field to the secondary coil.
    iii. Secondary Coil → Converts the magnetic field back into electrical energy at a different voltage.

    Efficiency formula:   
          n = [Output power/ Input power] X 100%
    Where:
    High Efficiency (~98%) means minimal energy loss.
    
    Real-World Example: Mobile Charger 🔋📱
    A mobile charger steps down 230V AC to 5V DC using a transformer and rectifier.

  3. Synchronous speed:
    Synchronous speed is a critical parameter in AC machines, particularly in induction and synchronous motors. 
    It refers to the speed of the rotating magnetic field produced by the stator windings. This speed is determined by the following formula:

    Synchronous Speed (Ns) = (120 * f) / P
    where:
    f is the frequency of the AC supply (in Hertz)
    P is the number of poles in the stator winding
    
    For example, a 4-pole motor connected to a 60 Hz supply will have a synchronous speed of:
    Ns = (120 * 60) / 4 = 1800 RPM
    Slip (s) = [(Ns – Nr) / Ns] * 100%
    Torque Production: Slip is necessary for an induction motor to produce torque. 
    The slip of an induction motor typically ranges from 2% to 5% at full load.


  4. DC motors & AC motors:
  1️⃣ DC Motors (Direct Current Motors)
      Works on direct current (DC) supply.
      Speed can be easily controlled by varying voltage or current.
      Used in battery-operated devices, robotics, and vehicles.
      
      Types of DC Motors:
      1.1 DC Series Motor
      High starting torque but speed varies with load.
      Used in: Electric trains 🚆, cranes 🏗️, and elevators.
      
      1.2 DC Shunt Motor
      Constant speed operation, independent of load.
      Used in: Lathe machines, fans, and conveyors.
      
      1.3 DC Compound Motor
      Combination of series and shunt motors → High torque & steady speed.
      Used in: Printing presses 🖨️, rolling mills.
      
      Real-World Example: Toy Cars 🚗
      A DC motor inside the toy car runs on batteries (direct current), making the wheels turn.
      
  2️⃣ AC Motors (Alternating Current Motors)
      Works on alternating current (AC) supply.
      Commonly used in household appliances and industries.
      
      Types of AC Motors:
      2.1 Induction Motor (Most Common)
      Self-starting and no need for brushes/commutators.
      Used in: Fans, washing machines, pumps.
      
      (a) Single-Phase Induction Motor
      Used in: Ceiling fans, refrigerators, water pumps.
      
      (b) Three-Phase Induction Motor
      Used in: Industries (conveyors, compressors, large machines).
      
      2.2 Synchronous Motor
      Runs at a constant speed synchronized with supply frequency.
      Used in: Clocks ⏰, synchronous generators in power plants.
      
      Real-World Example: Ceiling Fan 🌬️
      An induction motor in the fan converts AC power into mechanical rotation.
