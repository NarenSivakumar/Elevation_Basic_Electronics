1. Semiconductor: 
    Defintion: A semiconductor is a material that has electrical conductivity between a Conductor [copper, aluminium] and an Insulator [glass, rubber].
    It can conduct electricity under certain conditions, making it the foundation of modern electronic devices.

    Basic Properties of Semiconductors
    i. Resistivity: Lies between conductors and insulators.

    ii. Temperature Effect: As temperature increases, resistance decreases (opposite to metals).

    iii. Band Gap: Has a small energy gap between the valence and conduction bands (~1 eV).

    iv. Doping: Can be modified to enhance electrical properties.

    Types of semiconductor:
    i. intrinsic: pure semiconductor
    ii. Extrinsic: doped semiconductor

    i. Intrinsic: An Intrinsic semiconductor is a pure form of semiconductor without impurities.
      Example : Silicon [Si] , Germanium [Ge].

    ii. Extrinsic: An Extrinsic semiconductor is formed by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with impurities to its connectivity.
      Types of Extrinsic Semiconductors:
       i.  N-type Semiconductor (Donor-doped)
       ii. P-type Semiconductor (Acceptor-doped)

      Real-World Example: Coffee & Sugar Analogy ‚òïüçö
      Imagine a cup of coffee (semiconductor material).
      If you drink it without adding anything, it‚Äôs a pure coffee‚Äîthis is like an intrinsic semiconductor (pure Si or Ge).
      
      However, if you add sugar or milk, it changes the taste‚Äîthis is like an extrinsic semiconductor, where doping modifies conductivity.
      
      N-type vs. P-type Analogy:
      
      N-type Semiconductor (Donor-doped) ‚Üí Adding Extra Sugar üçö
      If you add extra sugar, the coffee becomes sweeter.
      Similarly, in an N-type semiconductor, extra electrons (negative charge) are added, increasing conductivity.
      
      P-type Semiconductor (Acceptor-doped) ‚Üí Missing Sugar üï≥Ô∏è
      If you forget to add sugar, the coffee feels less sweet, leaving a "gap."
      Similarly, in a P-type semiconductor, extra holes (positive charge carriers) are created, making it conductive.
      
      Key Takeaway:
      Intrinsic semiconductor = Pure coffee ‚òï
      
      N-type semiconductor = Coffee with extra sugar üçö (extra electrons)
      
      P-type semiconductor = Coffee without sugar üï≥Ô∏è (holes created)

2. Rectifiers: 
    Definition: A Rectifier is an Electronic device that is used to converts AC into DC.
    It allows current flows in only one direction and it's commonly used in power supplies.

    Types:
    i. Half-wave Rectifier
    ii. Full-wave Rectifier: Center-tapped full wave rectifier and Bridge Rectifier.

    1. Half-Wave Rectifier
        Uses one diode to convert AC to DC.
        
        Only the positive half-cycle of AC is allowed, and the negative half is blocked.
        
        Output is pulsating DC (not smooth)
        
    Working:
        During the positive half-cycle of AC, the diode is forward-biased (conducts).
        
        During the negative half-cycle, the diode is reverse-biased (blocks current).
        
        The output is a series of pulses (only the positive cycles).
        
        Disadvantages:
        Inefficient (wastes half of the AC signal).
        
        Ripple effect (not smooth DC).

        2. Full-Wave Rectifier (Center-Tap)
        Uses two diodes and a center-tapped transformer.
        
        Converts both halves of AC into DC.
        
        More efficient than a half-wave rectifier.
        
        Working:
        During the positive half-cycle, one diode conducts.
        
        During the negative half-cycle, the other diode conducts.
        
        Both cycles contribute to the output, reducing power loss.
        
        Disadvantages:
        Requires a center-tapped transformer (costly).

        3. Bridge Rectifier (Most Common)
        Uses four diodes in a bridge configuration.
        
        No center-tap transformer required.
        
        Converts both half-cycles of AC into DC.
        
        Working:
        During the positive half-cycle, two diodes conduct.
        
        During the negative half-cycle, the other two diodes conduct.
        
        The result is a continuous pulsating DC output.
        
        Advantages:
        More efficient than half-wave and center-tap rectifiers.
        
        Does not require a center-tapped transformer.
        
        Provides higher DC output voltage.


    Real-World Example: Charging a Mobile Phone üì±‚ö°
        Imagine you plug your phone charger into an AC power socket.
        
        The rectifier inside the charger converts AC (from the wall socket, 230V AC) to DC (used by the phone, typically 5V DC).
        
        If the charger used a Half-Wave Rectifier, it would charge very slowly and inefficiently.
        
        Instead, a Bridge Rectifier is used for efficient, smooth DC power conversion.
        
        Key Takeaway:
        Half-Wave Rectifier = Like drinking water only every alternate sip ü•§ (inefficient).
        
        Full-Wave Rectifier = Like drinking water every sip, but with a break (better).
        
        Bridge Rectifier = Like drinking water smoothly and continuously (most efficient).
