1. Semiconductor: 
    Defintion: A semiconductor is a material that has electrical conductivity between a Conductor [copper, aluminium] and an Insulator [glass, rubber].
    It can conduct electricity under certain conditions, making it the foundation of modern electronic devices.

    Basic Properties of Semiconductors
    i. Resistivity: Lies between conductors and insulators.

    ii. Temperature Effect: As temperature increases, resistance decreases (opposite to metals).

    iii. Band Gap: Has a small energy gap between the valence and conduction bands (~1 eV).

    iv. Doping: Can be modified to enhance electrical properties.

    Types of semiconductor:
    i. intrinsic: pure semiconductor
    ii. Extrinsic: doped semiconductor

    i. Intrinsic: An Intrinsic semiconductor is a pure form of semiconductor without impurities.
      Example : Silicon [Si] , Germanium [Ge].

    ii. Extrinsic: An Extrinsic semiconductor is formed by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with impurities to its connectivity.
      Types of Extrinsic Semiconductors:
       i.  N-type Semiconductor (Donor-doped)
       ii. P-type Semiconductor (Acceptor-doped)

      Real-World Example: Coffee & Sugar Analogy ‚òïüçö
      Imagine a cup of coffee (semiconductor material).
      If you drink it without adding anything, it‚Äôs a pure coffee‚Äîthis is like an intrinsic semiconductor (pure Si or Ge).
      
      However, if you add sugar or milk, it changes the taste‚Äîthis is like an extrinsic semiconductor, where doping modifies conductivity.
      
      N-type vs. P-type Analogy:
      
      N-type Semiconductor (Donor-doped) ‚Üí Adding Extra Sugar üçö
      If you add extra sugar, the coffee becomes sweeter.
      Similarly, in an N-type semiconductor, extra electrons (negative charge) are added, increasing conductivity.
      
      P-type Semiconductor (Acceptor-doped) ‚Üí Missing Sugar üï≥Ô∏è
      If you forget to add sugar, the coffee feels less sweet, leaving a "gap."
      Similarly, in a P-type semiconductor, extra holes (positive charge carriers) are created, making it conductive.
      
      Key Takeaway:
      Intrinsic semiconductor = Pure coffee ‚òï
      
      N-type semiconductor = Coffee with extra sugar üçö (extra electrons)
      
      P-type semiconductor = Coffee without sugar üï≥Ô∏è (holes created)
