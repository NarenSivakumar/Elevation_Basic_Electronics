  1. DC-DC converters - Choppers
      Definition: DC-DC converters also known as Choppers. It's used to convert a fixed DC input voltage
      into variable DC output voltage.

    Types:
      i. Buck - Reduces voltage like stepdown
      ii. Boost - Increase the voltage like stepup
      iii. Buck-Boost - Increases or Decreases the voltage depending on requirement

    Real-world example:
      Mobile Phone Charger: Inside your charger, a buck converter reduces the 5V USB voltage to around
      3.7V to charge your phone battery safely.

    2. Single-phase and Three-phase Inverters

      Definition: An inverter converts DC power into AC power.
      Single-phase Inverter: Produces single-phase AC output (used in households)
      Three-phase Inverter: Produces 3-phase AC output (used in industrial motors)
      
      Real-World Examples:
      Single-phase Inverter:
      Home UPS systems use single-phase inverters to supply AC power from a battery during power cuts.
      
      Three-phase Inverter:
      Electric Vehicle (EV) Motor Drives use three-phase inverters to control the 3-phase motor's speed and torque.

      3. PWM - Pulse Width Modulation - Short: Inverter - controls op voltage and frequency.
        Definition: PWM is used in inverters to control output voltage and frequency by adjusting the pulse widths of 
        the switches.

        i. Sinusoidal PWM
          Working:
          A sine wave (reference signal) is compared with a high-frequency triangular wave (carrier signal) to generate PWM signals.
  
          Real-World Example:
           ðŸŒž Solar Inverters: SPWM is used to convert DC from solar panels to smooth AC that matches the grid frequency.

        ii. Space Vector PWM (SVPWM)
          Working:
          SVPWM is a more advanced technique that uses the concept of space vectors and sector switching to get better voltage utilization.
          
          Real-World Example:
          ðŸš— Electric Cars (like Tesla): SVPWM is used in motor controllers for higher efficiency and smoother motor performance compared to SPWM.

  Extra : Voltage source and Current source Inverters
          VSI:
          âš¡ UPS systems and EV motor drives use VSIs because voltage control is needed.
          
          CSI:
          ðŸ”¥ Industrial Induction Heating applications use CSIs, where a constant current is needed for consistent heat.
