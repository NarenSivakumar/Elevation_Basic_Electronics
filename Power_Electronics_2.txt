CHAPTER - DC to DC Converters

1. DC-DC converters - Choppers
      Definition: DC-DC converters also known as Choppers. It's used to convert a fixed DC input voltage
      into variable DC output voltage.

    Types:
      i. Buck - Reduces voltage like stepdown
      ii. Boost - Increase the voltage like stepup
      iii. Buck-Boost - Increases or Decreases the voltage depending on requirement

    Real-world example:
      Mobile Phone Charger: Inside your charger, a buck converter reduces the 5V USB voltage to around
      3.7V to charge your phone battery safely.

    2. Single-phase and Three-phase Inverters

      Definition: An inverter converts DC power into AC power.
      Single-phase Inverter: Produces single-phase AC output (used in households)
      Three-phase Inverter: Produces 3-phase AC output (used in industrial motors)
      
      Real-World Examples:
      Single-phase Inverter:
      Home UPS systems use single-phase inverters to supply AC power from a battery during power cuts.
      
      Three-phase Inverter:
      Electric Vehicle (EV) Motor Drives use three-phase inverters to control the 3-phase motor's speed and torque.

      3. PWM - Pulse Width Modulation - Short: Inverter - controls op voltage and frequency.
        Definition: PWM is used in inverters to control output voltage and frequency by adjusting the pulse widths of 
        the switches.

        i. Sinusoidal PWM
          Working:
          A sine wave (reference signal) is compared with a high-frequency triangular wave (carrier signal) to generate PWM signals.
  
          Real-World Example:
           ðŸŒž Solar Inverters: SPWM is used to convert DC from solar panels to smooth AC that matches the grid frequency.

        ii. Space Vector PWM (SVPWM)
          Working:
          SVPWM is a more advanced technique that uses the concept of space vectors and sector switching to get better voltage utilization.
          
          Real-World Example:
          ðŸš— Electric Cars (like Tesla): SVPWM is used in motor controllers for higher efficiency and smoother motor performance compared to SPWM.

  Extra : Voltage source and Current source Inverters
          VSI:
          âš¡ UPS systems and EV motor drives use VSIs because voltage control is needed.
          
          CSI:
          ðŸ”¥ Industrial Induction Heating applications use CSIs, where a constant current is needed for consistent heat.

    4. SMPS Detailed - Switched Mode Power Supplies  
      Definition: A switched-mode power supply (SMPS) is a power electronics topology, which consists of two power stages.
      The first stage converts the ac supply into dc and the second stage converts the dc voltage to the desired dc output voltage.

      What is SMPS?
      It is an electronic power supply that converts electrical power efficiently using switching devices (like transistors) that turn on and off at high speed.

       Why is SMPS used?
      SMPS is used to convert one type of voltage to another (like AC to DC, DC to DC, etc.) with high efficiency, low heat, and compact size.
